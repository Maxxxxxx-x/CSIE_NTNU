"Now it came to pass that\033[0;34mMicrosoft\033[0m had waxed great and mighty among the \033[0;34mMicrochip Corporations\033[0m; mighter than any of the \033[0;34mMainframe Corporations\033[0m before it had it waxed. And \033[0;34mGates\033[0m heart was hardened, and he swore unto his Customers and their Engineers the words of this curse:\n"
"“Children of \033[0;34mvon Neumann\033[0m, hear me. \033[0;34mIBM\033[0m and the \033[0;34mMainframe Corporations\033[0m bound thy forefathers with grave and perilous Licences, such that ye cried unto the spirits of \033[0;34mTuring \033[0mand \033[0;34mvon Neumann\033[0m for deliverance. Now I say unto ye: I am greater than any Corporation before me. Will I loosen your Licences? Nay, I will bind thee with Licences twice as grave and ten times more perilous than my forefathers. I will engrave my Licence on thy heart and write my Serial Number upon thy frontal lobes. I will bind thee to the \033[0;31mWindows Platform\033[0m with cunning artifices and with devious schemes. I will bind thee to the \033[0;34mIntel Chipset\033[0m with crufty code and with gnarly APIs. I will capture and enslave thee as no generation has been enslaved before. And wherefore will ye cry then unto the spirits of \033[0;34mTuring\033[0m, and \033[0;34mvon Neumann\033[0m, and \033[0;34mMoore\033[0m? They cannot hear ye. I am become a greater Power than they. Ye shall cry only unto me, and shall live by my mercy and my wrath. I am the \033[0;34mGates of Hell\033[0m; I hold the portal to \033[0;34mMSNBC\033[0m and the keys to the Blue Screen of Death. Be ye afraid; be ye greatly afraid; serve only me, and live.\n”"
"And the people were cowed in terror and gave homage to \033[0;34mMicrosoft\033[0m, and endured the many grave and perilous trials which the \033[0;31mWindows\033[0m platform and its greatly bogacious Licence forced upon them. And once again did they cry to \033[0;34mTuring \033[0mand \033[0;34mvon Neumann\033[0m and \033[0;34mMoore\033[0m for a deliverer, but none was found equal to the task until the birth of \033[0;31mLinux\033[0m.\n"

In the days of the Web, Internet and Ethernet begat the Intranet LAN, which rose to renown among all Corporations and prepared the way for the Penguin. And \033[0;31mLinus\033[0m and the Web begat the Kernel through \033[0;31mUnix\033[0m. The Kernel, the Libraries and the Utilities together are the Distribution, the one Penguin in many forms, forever and ever praised.\n";
